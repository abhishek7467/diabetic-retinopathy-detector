1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System is a full-stack web application designed to enable early, accurate, and accessible detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) from retinal images. It leverages deep learning (YOLOv8) for image classification, robust user management, and secure, scalable web technologies to deliver a solution suitable for clinical and telemedicine use.

Key Features:
  - AI-powered retinal image classification using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model.
  - Multi-user authentication and authorization with role-based access (admin, user).
  - Patient history tracking, analytics, and trend visualization.
  - PDF report generation with embedded QR codes for verification.
  - Multi-channel OTP verification (Email & SMS) for password resets.
  - Admin dashboard for system monitoring and user management.
  - Responsive, modern web interface with accessibility features.
  - Real-time notifications and alerts for users.
  - Data export (CSV, JSON) and secure sharing capabilities.
  - Security and privacy features suitable for healthcare compliance (HIPAA-ready).

2. PROJECT OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem Statement:
  Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness among adults globally. Early detection is critical, but access to expert screening is limited, especially in rural and underserved regions. Manual screening is time-consuming, subjective, and resource-intensive. There is a need for an automated, scalable, and accurate system to assist clinicians and empower patients.

Solution Approach:
  This project provides a web-based platform where users (patients or clinicians) can upload retinal images. The system processes these images using a YOLOv8 deep learning model, classifies the stage of DR, and provides detailed results, analytics, and downloadable reports. The platform is designed for extensibility, security, and ease of use, with a focus on clinical workflow integration.

Target Users:
  - Healthcare professionals (ophthalmologists, diabetologists, GPs)
  - Patients with diabetes requiring regular screening
  - Healthcare administrators and telemedicine providers

3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

Technology Stack (with details):
  - Backend: Flask 2.3.3 (Python web framework)
  - ORM: SQLAlchemy 2.0.41 (object-relational mapping)
  - AI/ML: Ultralytics YOLOv8 (PyTorch-based), custom-trained for DR
  - Frontend: Bootstrap 5, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
