SLIDE 2: THE GLOBAL HEALTH CHALLENGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SLIDE TITLE: "Diabetic Retinopathy: A Silent Vision Thief"

MAIN CONTENT:
STATISTICS AND IMPACT:
- 463 million adults worldwide have diabetes (WHO, 2024)
- 1 in 3 people with diabetes will develop diabetic retinopathy
- Leading cause of blindness in working-age adults (20-74 years)
- Early detection can prevent 95% of severe vision loss
- Only 50% of diabetic patients receive recommended annual eye exams

THE PROBLEM LANDSCAPE:
- Geographic barriers: Limited access to specialists in rural areas
- Economic constraints: High cost of regular ophthalmologic care  
- Healthcare system overload: Insufficient specialists for growing patient population
- Inconsistent screening: Variable quality and availability of screening services
- Late detection: Many cases identified only after irreversible damage occurs

SLIDE 3: UNDERSTANDING DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SLIDE TITLE: "From Healthy Vision to Sight-Threatening Disease"

MAIN CONTENT:
DISEASE PROGRESSION OVERVIEW:
Diabetic retinopathy develops as high blood sugar levels damage the tiny blood vessels in the retina over time. The progression typically follows five distinct stages, each requiring different levels of medical intervention and monitoring.

THE FIVE CLASSIFICATION STAGES:
1. No Diabetic Retinopathy (No DR)
   - Retina appears normal with no visible changes
   - Continued monitoring recommended
   - Focus on diabetes management and prevention

2. Mild Diabetic Retinopathy  
   - Small areas of swelling in retinal blood vessels (microaneurysms)
   - First detectable signs of disease
   - Increased monitoring frequency recommended

3. Moderate Diabetic Retinopathy
   - Blood vessels become blocked, depriving retinal areas of blood supply
   - More extensive microaneurysms and small hemorrhages
   - May require closer ophthalmologic follow-up

4. Severe Diabetic Retinopathy
   - Many more blood vessels are blocked
   - Significant areas of retina deprived of blood supply
   - High risk of progression to proliferative stage

5. Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy
   - Most advanced and sight-threatening stage
   - New abnormal blood vessels grow on retinal surface
   - Immediate medical intervention required

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Side-by-side retinal images showing each stage progression
- Anatomical diagram of healthy eye vs. diabetic retinopathy affected eye
- Timeline graphic showing disease progression over years
- Color-coded severity indicators for each stage

SPEAKER NOTES:
Explain that understanding disease progression is crucial for both early detection and appropriate treatment timing. Emphasize that the early stages often have no symptoms, making regular screening essential. Note that our AI system can detect subtle changes that might be missed in routine examinations, particularly in the crucial early stages where intervention is most effective.
